# hello-world
First repository. Yay.

Well hello, I'm Nicki from cannedSunlight web design, coding now on GitHub!
I'm very good at building websites with WordPress, troubleshooting and fixing WordPress problems and making plugins work nicely together.

I am also a certified WPML support specialist and can help with multilingual websites in WordPress and WPML.
